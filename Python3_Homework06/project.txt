Python 3: The Python Environment
Lesson 6, Project 1

Here are your instructions:
Create a Python3_Homework06 project and assign it to your Python3_Homework working set. 
In the Python3_Homework06/src folder, create a program named ccn_safety2.py that duplicates the 
ccn_safety.py program's functionality, but uses a compiled regular expression to replace the credit card numbers 
in the paragraph with "CCN REMOVED FOR YOUR SAFETY". Use the following text as a sample:

Text to use in ccn_safety2.py

Have you ever noticed, in television and movies, that phone numbers and credit cardsare obviously fake numbers 
like 555-123-4567 or 5555-5555-5555-5555? It is because a number that appears to be real, such as 1234-5678-1234-5678, 
triggers the attention of privacy and security experts.

Your project should meet the following conditions:

+ The program should return this text: 
"Have you ever noticed, in television and movies, that phone numbers and credit cards are obviously fake numbers 
like 555-123-4567 or CCN REMOVED FOR YOUR SAFETY? It is because a number that appears to be real, such as CCN REMOVED FOR YOUR SAFETY, 
triggers the attention of privacy and security experts." Note that phone numbers should not be replaced! 
+ You should include a test_ccn_safety2.py program in a separate file that confirms that your code functions as expected. 
+ You must use the re.VERBOSE flag to properly document each element of the pattern used to identify credit card numbers.


Submit ccn_safety2.py and test_ccn_safety2.py when they are working to your satisfaction.
