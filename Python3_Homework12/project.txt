Python 3: The Python Environment
Lesson 12, Project 1

Here are your instructions:
Create a Python3_Homework12 project and assign it to your Python3_Homework working set. 
In the Python3_Homework12/src folder, copy property_address.py and test_property_address.py from the last project. 
Modify property_address.py to accept the following options if called directly, with the five address values used to 
instantiate an Address class if no parser errors are thrown.

option default address? task 
-l/--level INFO yes Sets the log level to DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL 
-n/--name Throws a parser error if empty yes Sets the name value of the Address object 
-a/--address Throws a parser error if empty yes Sets the street_address value of the Address object 
-c/--city Throws a parser error if empty yes Sets the city value of the Address object 
-s/--state Throws a parser error if empty yes Sets the state value of the Address object 
-z/--zip_code Throws a parser error if empty yes Sets the zip_code value of the Address object 

If you run your code with the following command-line arguments:

property_address.py -n Tom -a "my street" -c "San Diego" -s "CA" -z 21045

...you should see something like this in property_address.log:

2010-10-11 14:48:59,794 - INFO - __init__ - Creating a new address 
Note: When you use the ${string_prompt} or direct input option in the Eclipse run configuration, 
you can't use single quotes ('). If your input requires quotes, use double quotes ("), so the full string is parsed 
rather than breaking at white space.
    
If you run your code without command-line arguments, you should see:

Usage: property_address.py [options]property_address.py: error: options -n, -a, -c, -s, -z are required 
If you run your code with the following command-line arguments:

property_address.py -l WARNING -n Tom -a "my street" -c "San Diego" -s "CA" -z "EZ 123"
...you should see:

usage: property_address.py [options]property_address.py: error: option -z requires a valid 5-digit US zip code 
...AND you should see something like this in property_address.log:
content appended to property_address.log
2010-10-11 17:10:32,702 - ERROR - ZipCodeError - ZIPCODE exception 
Note: Your date and time values will vary.

Now, modify your propertyaddress.py program to use the configparser library to load the settings from the 
following property_address.cfg config file: 

propertyaddress.cfg
[log]
format = %(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s
output = homework12.log
[validators]
zip_code = \d{5}\-\d{4}$
state = [A-Z]{3}$

As you can see, the log formatting, log output, and Address validators are different from what you currently have.

Your project must meet the following conditions:

Change the tests in test_property_address.py so they run correctly. 
Also, the results of your logfile should appear as below:

content appended to homework12.log
2010-10-11 17:34:38,968 - root - ERROR - STATE exception
2010-10-11 17:34:39,098 - root - ERROR - ZIPCODE exception
2010-10-11 17:34:39,112 - root - INFO - Creating a new address
2010-10-11 17:34:39,113 - root - ERROR - NAME exception
2010-10-11 17:34:39,113 - root - INFO - Creating a new address
2010-10-11 17:34:39,113 - root - INFO - Creating a new address 
Note: Your date and time values will vary.

Submit property_address.py, and test_property_address.py, and property_address.cfg 
when your programs are working to your satisfaction.

Your Comment:
The homework requires the "NAME exception" output in the logfile 
but I did not see any requirement on implementing it in the homework description.
Did I miss something?

Overall Comments:
Well done.
The name setter may have acquired a logging capability along the way in the author's 
version but I don't require it.  The AttributeError test is enough.
