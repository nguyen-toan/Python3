Python 3: The Python Environment
Lesson 4, Project 1

Here are your instructions:
Create a Python3_Homework04 project and assign it to your Python3_Homework working set. In the Python3_Homework04/src folder, create a program named find_regex.py that takes the following text and finds the start and end positions of the phrase, "Regular Expressions".

Text to use in find_regex.py
In the 1950s, mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene described automata theory and formal language theoryin a set of models using a notation called "regular sets" as a method to do pattern matching. Activeusage of this system, called Regular Expressions, started in the 1960s and continued under such pioneers as David J. Farber, Ralph E. Griswold, Ivan P. Polonsky, Ken Thompson, and Henry Spencer.
Your project should meet the following conditions:

Your code must return 231 as the start and 250 as the end. 
You must include a separate test_find_regex.py program that confirms that your code functions as instructed.
Submit find_regex.py and test_find_regex.py when they are working to your satisfaction.

Overall Comments:
Well done.

There are several ways to format multipline text so as not to introduce extra whitespace.

    text = ( "this is another"
    " way to do it"
    " where you put text in separate quoted sections"
    " with no commas.")
