Python 3: The Python Environment
Lesson 8, Project 1

Here are your instructions:
Create a Python3_Homework08 project and assign it to your Python3_Homework working set. 
In the Python3_Homework08/src folder, create a program named wiretimes.py that reads the wireshark.bin data file 
dumped from the wireshark program (to get it, right-click the link 

http://courses.oreillyschool.com/Python3/software/wireshark.bin

select Save Target As, and save the file to your Python3_Homework08/src folder.). The file begins with a header:

Wireshark file header:
 guint32 magic_number; /* magic number */ 
 guint16 version_major; /* major version number */ 
 guint16 version_minor; /* minor version number */ 
 gint32 thiszone; /* GMT to local correction */ 
 guint32 sigfigs; /* accuracy of timestamps */ 
 guint32 snaplen; /* max length of captured packets, in octets */ 
 guint32 network; /* data link type */

Each packet is then preceded by a four-entry header:

 guint32 ts_sec; /* timestamp seconds */ 
 guint32 ts_usec; /* timestamp microseconds */ 
 guint32 incl_len; /* number of octets of packet saved in file */ 
 guint32 orig_len; /* actual length of packet */

For more detailed information about the wireshark dump file format, see 
http://wiki.wireshark.org/Development/LibpcapFileFormat.


Print the timestamp for each packet in seconds and microseconds.

Submit wiretimes.py when it is working to your satisfaction.
