Python 3: The Python Environment
Lesson 1, Project 1

Here are your instructions:
Create a Python3_Homework01 project and assign it to your Python3_Homework working set. 
In the Python3_Homework01/src folder, create a program named adder.py; in it, create a function that takes two objects 
and adds them together only if they are both of the integer type. Raise a TypeError otherwise.  
Then, create a test_adder.py file that tests the correctness of this function.

When they are working to your satisfaction, submit adder.py and test_adder.py.

Overall Comments:
This is a good project in which to remove misconceptions about assertRaises.

        self.assertRaises(TypeError, adder, ("123", "456"))

You are correct to just name the callable after the expected exception, with 
no arguments, but then should use individual arguments for adder, and not
try to stuff everything in a tuple.  The above only succeeds in pass 
("123", "456") to x, the first parameter, and so raises a TypeError because
of a wrong number of arguments, not because they are strings.  Rather, go:

        self.assertRaises(TypeError, adder, "123", "456")

This allows the callable to even have keyword arguments, and is why message=
or any error message is not possible --
