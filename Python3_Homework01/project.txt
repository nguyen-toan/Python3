Python 3: The Python Environment
Lesson 1, Project 1

Here are your instructions:
Create a Python3_Homework01 project and assign it to your Python3_Homework working set. 
In the Python3_Homework01/src folder, create a program named adder.py; in it, create a function that takes two objects 
and adds them together only if they are both of the integer type. Raise a TypeError otherwise.  
Then, create a test_adder.py file that tests the correctness of this function.

When they are working to your satisfaction, submit adder.py and test_adder.py.
